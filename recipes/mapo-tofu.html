        <h2>A Delicious Dish from Sichuan Province</h2>
        <p>This recipe is a favorite of mine for two key reasons, flavor and ease of execution. It is spicy, savory,
            and full of that unique tongue-numbing peppercorn spice you can only from authentic Sichuan cuisine. As a
            total novice in the kitchen, I can whip up a bowl of Mapo Tofu easily, for a satisfying restaurant quality experience.
