        <h2>A Savory Pancake from Japan</h2>
        <p>On the recommendation of a good friend, I tried Okonomiyaki the first time I visited Japan.
        First in Osaka, an eclectic culinary metropolis, where I fell in love with the dish, I was informed
        that there are various regional styles of Okonomiyaki to try. So I made it my mission to try this dish
        everywhere I went. Variations of styles and ingredients are an important part of what makes this dish so special.
        </p>
        <p>The name "Okonomiyaki" translates to "Grilled as you like it", and as the name implies, this recipe
            leaves a lot of room for experimentation and expression to serve the unique tastes of people enjoying the food.
            In this recipe I will focus on Osaka style Okonomiyaki, but I encourage you to try all the regional recipes available.
